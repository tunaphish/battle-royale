# Act 1 - Youth, Idealism
You are joining an elite magical school full of eclectic group of individuals to hang out with.  Your goal is to get sponsored by a royal family and join them to be able to be a wizard. However, during the course of the school year you start to see the trials and tribulations wizards face becoming a scion of a royal family. You have a friendly rivalry with Dimitri who is the prodigal son. You build relationships with a bunch of students. It’s a time of idealism.

First you buy into the system, everything is awesome. You are going to classes learning cool ass spells. You are making cool friends. You get your wand and robes and your familiar. Royal families derive their power from gods who have dominion over certain sectors of life. The coolest is obviously the ones that specialize in warfare. But they can be mild like agriculture and such. The god of delivery is one of the strongest gods surprisingly. 


# Act 2 - Adulthood, Reality
Eventually you get noticed as a chad. You get picked into society and become a member. This is where the repetition comes in. The meat grinder. You meet your friends for drinks and everyone is tired. You see your friends burn out. 

Then you start to realize the reality of this world. Wizards face mental and physical abuse, death in some circumstances. But it’s all seen to be worth it as you get access to magic. To be a wizard. Getting closer to characters reveal the specifics of how they’re abused by the system. Individuals who reject godhood are seen as heathens, those who reject a higher power, who reject life itself. You straight up have no power so you continue down the path. You are convinced. 

> This is what life is. We had fun in school but you need to grow up. We have a responsibility to our community. To the world.


## Climax - Change
You find out the truth of society as you rise up. There are no gods. Only individuals who’ve coalesced magic that they’ve reached immortality. The royal family and scion structure of society is to prop up these individuals. It funnels magic through them so they are able to stay alive forever. They never die and become ‘gods’. Few are privy to this secret are you are meant to join them. Mur Burns, God of Delivery. 

- Mur Burns: Those who are capable would rise to my level. Instead you’d have me fall to theirs. The society works because those who can walk the path can enter godhood.
- Protagonist: To reach the heights you’ve reached, you have to exploit everyone. 
- Mur Burns: Leadership is a burden. Responsibility for the world, but the power matches not. I do not hold the knife that enters their bodies. 
- Protag: But you hold the policies. 
- Mur Burns: And how would you do the hard thing 
- Protag: ... 
- Mur Burns: Idealism from youth

# Capitalism Critique

## Immortality and Power Coalescing
Magic is the allegory for getting magic. Magic comes from high families who have the grace of gods. Gods are just individuals are obtained immortality. They are able to shape the rules to be because they ordained life to be so. They accumulated all the magic in order to maintain their immortality and siphon power to the top. There is literally nothing you can do as an individual. 

Immortality only available to the wealthiest. Stays that way. Consolidation of power. 


## Royal Families == Companies
When we coalesce power through certain channels, decisions become easier. People have their place in life. You don’t need to think or take on any risk. Just work, have a family and live a good life. Isn’t that all anyone wants? Royal Families are an allegory for industries and companies. 

### Character Association with Symbolism and Lore
Associating runes or other design patterns with characters. Runes are associated with noble families and the magical school. High families are associated with crests (brands?). 

## Noblesse Oblige
Are some people truly meant to lead other people? The prodigal son thinks so. The belief that there are some people who are truly better then other people. 

Final boss is one of the best houses. The prodigal son. A true leader. No flaws. Nothing to take advantage of. There is no expectation for you. 

## Warfare
War powers the capitalism mindset and individualism. Magic is particularly celebrated because it’s mass destructive capabilities. All wizards are trained in warfare and battle and dueling is one of the most celebrated past times.
